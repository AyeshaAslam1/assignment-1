# assignment-1
i've made 3 .cpp file, namely complex.cpp that contains all the operations performed on the complex numbers, 
linkedlist.cpp that contains all the functions where complex numbers are added in the list, 
main.cpp that contains the complex numbers that are pushed.

header file to complex and linkedlist is created, inorder to copy the library and use it in the main function. 

the output is: 
4+5i , 3-3i , 4+3i
4+5i , 3-3i , 4+3i, 7+2i
4+5i , 3-3i , 4+3i, 7+2i, 0+2i
4+5i , 3-3i , 4+3i, 7+2i, 0+2i, 21+3i
4+5i , 3-3i , 4+3i, 7+2i, 0+2i, 21+3i, 4.42857 + -1.14286i

now deletepos(y) function will delete the complex function at position 4
